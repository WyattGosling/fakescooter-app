Fake E-Scoot Sharing Service: iOS App

Just a dummpy app used to practice iOS development. This isn't meant to be a
real app. In order to use this, you will need to have the
[server](https://github.com/WyattGosling/fakescooter-server) running on
localhost.

# Usage

At this point in time, the app is made around being run entirely in the iOS
simulator in Xcode. The app will need the
[server](https://github.com/WyattGosling/fakescooter-server) running on
localhost.

As long as the server is running, you can press ▶️ in Xcode and use the app in
the simulator.
